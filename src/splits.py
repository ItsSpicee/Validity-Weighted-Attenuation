-------------
Single source of truth for the professor-level data split.

The split is defined once here and reused by regression (model training),
attenuation (s-value selection) and the reporting visualizations, so the three
stages cannot drift apart. Drift would reintroduce circularity: results are only
clean if the professors used to fit the model and tune s are the same ones
excluded from the reported metrics.

Splitting is on professor rather than review because reviews of the same
professor are correlated; a review-level split would leak across the boundary.
